Iris Classifier with FastAPI
Overview
This project implements a REST API to classify Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using a Random Forest classifier. Built with FastAPI, it provides a /predict endpoint to predict species based on sepal and petal measurements. This was developed as part of an AI Engineering Internship Assignment.

Language: Python
Framework: FastAPI
ML Model: Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)
API Features: Swagger UI for testing, asynchronous predictions

Prerequisites

Python 3.10+
Git (for cloning the repository)
Internet connection (for installing dependencies)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Classifier-FastAPI.git
cd Iris-Classifier-FastAPI

(Replace yourusername with your GitHub username.)

Set Up a Virtual Environment:

Windows:python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Mac/Linux:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate




Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Ensure requirements.txt includes: fastapi==0.115.0, uvicorn==0.30.6, scikit-learn==1.5.1, joblib==1.4.2, pydantic==2.9.2, numpy==1.26.4.)

Generate the Model (if model.pkl is missing):
python train_model.py

This trains the Random Forest model and saves it as model.pkl.


Usage

Run the API:
uvicorn main:app --reload


The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Use --port 8001 if port 8000 is busy.


Test the API:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/docs to access Swagger UI.
Navigate to the POST /predict endpoint.
Click “Try it out”, enter sample data (e.g.):{
  "sepal_length": 5.1,
  "sepal_width": 3.5,
  "petal_length": 1.4,
  "petal_width": 0.2
}


Click Execute. Expect a response like:{
  "species": "setosa",
  "probabilities": {
    "setosa": 0.99,
    "versicolor": 0.01,
    "virginica": 0.0
  }
}




Stop the Server:

Press Ctrl + C in the terminal.



Project Structure

main.py: FastAPI application with /predict endpoint.
train_model.py: Script to train and save the Random Forest model.
model.pkl: Trained model file (generated by train_model.py).
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.

Notes

This project was completed for an AI Engineering Internship Assignment (due July 23, 2025). The video demo, PPT, and summary were submitted separately.
The .gitignore file excludes large files (e.g., video, virtual environment) to keep the Git repository lightweight.
